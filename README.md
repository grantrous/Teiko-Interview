# Clinical Trial Data Management System

Hi Bob Loblaw! I hope this Python program helps you and Yah D'yada quickly analyze your clinical trial data and identify those treatment response biomarkers you've been looking for. I built this specifically to answer your three main questions about cell type frequencies, treatment response prediction, and baseline characteristics. Here's how you can get started and see your data come to life with interactive visualizations and statistical analysis.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Bob

Getting this running takes about 5 minutes. Download the files to your computer, open your terminal and navigate to the folder. Install the required packages with `pip install streamlit pandas plotly scipy numpy`, then start the program with `cd src` and `streamlit run app.py`. Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:8501`. Upload your CSV, click "Load Data into Database", and explore the analysis tabs that answer each of your specific research questions.

## üìÑ What Your CSV File Should Look Like

Your CSV file needs these exact column headers:

```csv
sample,project,subject,age,sex,condition,treatment,sample_type,time_from_treatment_start,response,b_cell,cd8_t_cell,cd4_t_cell,nk_cell,monocyte
```

Here's what goes in each column: `sample` is your unique ID like "SAMPLE_001", `project` is your study name like "MELANO_001", `subject` is the patient ID, `age` is just the number, `sex` should be "M" or "F", `condition` is things like "melanoma" or "healthy", `treatment` is "tr1", "tr2", "placebo", etc., `sample_type` is "PBMC", "tumor", or "serum", `time_from_treatment_start` is days since treatment started, `response` should be "y" for responders and "n" for non-responders (this is important for the statistical comparisons), and the last five columns are your cell counts as positive integers.

A sample row looks like: `SAMPLE_001,MELANO_001,PATIENT_001,45,M,melanoma,tr1,PBMC,0,y,800,2200,2800,1000,1500`

## üß™ Testing with Bigger Data

Want to test with more data? Run `python generate_big_dataset.py` and it'll create `big-cell-counts.csv` with 500+ realistic samples across multiple projects, treatments, and response rates.

## üóÉÔ∏è How the Database Works Behind the Scenes

I designed the database to handle your growing study efficiently. Instead of storing everything in one giant table, I split your data into logical pieces. Patient info like age, sex, and condition gets stored once per patient, not repeated for every sample. When you have 10 samples from the same patient, their demographics are stored once and referenced 10 times.

As your study grows to hundreds of projects and thousands of samples, the database stays fast because each table has indexes on the columns you search most often. It's like having a really good filing system that doesn't get slower as you add more files.

The structure makes it easy to answer questions like "show me all melanoma patients who got tr1 treatment" or "compare baseline vs week-12 samples" without scanning through everything. If you need to add new cell types later, just add columns to the cell counts table. New patient characteristics? Add them to the subjects table. The structure grows with your research needs.

## üî¨ Scientific Validation & Statistical Methods

The application provides publication-quality statistical analysis that will meet peer-review standards. For comparing treatment responders vs non-responders, I use independent t-tests to determine if differences in cell population frequencies are statistically significant. Effect sizes are calculated using Cohen's d so you can quantify not just whether differences exist, but how meaningful they are clinically.

All p-values are properly reported with standard significance thresholds, and confidence intervals are provided for comparative analyses. The system handles missing data appropriately by clearly reporting which samples are excluded from each analysis and why.

For data quality, there's input validation to catch formatting issues before they affect your results, and outlier detection flags unusual values for manual review. Sample size calculations help you understand the statistical power of your comparisons.

Everything uses standardized methodology so your results are reproducible, and all analyses can be downloaded in standard formats for collaboration with Yah D'yada or inclusion in publications. The statistical framework ensures your findings will be credible for regulatory submissions and peer review.

## üèóÔ∏è Why I Built It This Way

I focused on a research-friendly interface with point-and-click functionality that automatically updates analyses as you add new samples. The system handles real research workflows with data persistence across sessions, so you don't lose work when you close the program. You can add individual samples as new data arrives and use flexible filtering for evolving research questions.

For statistical credibility, I included proper hypothesis testing, effect size calculations, and publication-ready visualizations. The architecture scales from pilot studies to large multi-center trials without performance issues as your database grows.

## üî¨ What Each Analysis Tab Does

**Tab 1 - Cell Type Frequencies:** Answers your first question about relative frequencies and gives you the exact table format you requested with sample, total_count, population, count, and percentage columns.

**Tab 2 - Treatment Response Prediction:** Compares tr1 responders vs non-responders in melanoma PBMC samples with the boxplots and statistical tests you need to convince Yah D'yada.

**Tab 3 - Baseline Analysis:** Filters for those baseline melanoma PBMC samples and gives you the project, responder, and gender breakdowns you wanted.

**Tab 4 - Custom Exploration:** Lets you slice and dice the data any way you want as your research questions evolve throughout the study.

## üéØ A Few Things to Know

Your data persists between sessions, so once you load it, it stays loaded even if you close the program. Use the "Clear Database" button when you want to start fresh. You can add individual samples anytime using the "Add Sample" tab as new data arrives from the lab. Every analysis has a download button so you can save results for presentations or further analysis. Use the project and condition filters at the top to focus on specific subsets before running analyses. The Baseline tab is probably most useful for understanding your tr1 treatment effects early in the study.

Hope this accelerates your research and gives you the evidence you need for those important discussions with Yah D'yada!
